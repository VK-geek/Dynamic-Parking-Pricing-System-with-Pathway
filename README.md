# üöó Dynamic Parking Pricing System with Pathway

A real-time smart parking pricing engine that dynamically adjusts parking fees based on live conditions like occupancy, traffic, and vehicle type ‚Äî built using [Pathway](https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway).

> üèÅ Final Submission for **Summer Analytics 2025** Capstone Project

---

## üìå Overview

This system simulates a smart city parking network that:
- Streams parking data from a CSV in real time
- Applies a demand-based pricing algorithm
- Outputs live pricing to both terminal and `pricing_results.csv`

It is built for **real-time stream processing using Pathway**, with optional extensions like Bokeh dashboard.

## üí° Key Features

- üîÅ Real-time streaming with Pathway
- üìà Dynamic pricing based on demand
- üß† Considers vehicle type, traffic, occupancy, queue, special events
- üíæ Saves outputs to CSV
- üìä Optional: Add Bokeh for dashboards

---

## üß† Pricing Logic

The price is dynamically computed based on:
- **Occupancy Ratio** (occupancy / capacity)
- **Queue Length**
- **Traffic Condition** (`low`, `medium`, `high`)
- **Vehicle Type** (`car`, `bike`, `truck`)
- **Special Event Day**

The output is normalized using `tanh()` and bounded between `0.5x` and `2x` the base price.
